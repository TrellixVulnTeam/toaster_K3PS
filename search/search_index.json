Well, either way, keep reading to know all you need to know about how toaster packages work. Package files Every package has a TOML file named after the package, which describes how the package should be installed and uninstalled. Here is an example of how a bakery (a git repo with packages in it) may be structured: wxllow/toaster-core \u251c\u2500\u2500 _toaster.toml \u251c\u2500\u2500 coolexample \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 coolexample.toml \u251c\u2500\u2500 example \u2514\u2500\u2500 example.toml Basic information First in a package's TOML file is information like the name, version, license, dependencies, and which architectures/platforms it supports. Here is an example of how this may look: name = \"Python\" desc = \"Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.\" version = \"3.10.4\" version_type = \"release\" homepage = \"https://www.python.org/\" license = \"PSF\" archs = [\"arm64\", \"x86_64\"] linux_archs = [\"any\"] types = [\"binary\", \"build\"] dependencies = ['example', 'foo>=2.5'] uses = ['bar'] Name and Description (string name & string desc ) The first 2 things here are the name ( name ) and description ( desc ), which are pretty self-explanatory. Version (string version & string version_type ) Next is the version and the version type. These can be any string, but we recommend using a semantic version number and having version_type either be stable , development , prototype , beta , alpha , or something along those lines Homepage (string homepage ) A URL which has information about the package, can be anything. License (string license ) The license is pretty self-explanatory and can also be anything, but make sure that users are able to understand what the license means Archs (macOS) (array archs ) Here you can specify which architectures you wish to target on macOS, either universal , arm64 , or x86_64 Archs (Linux) (array linux_archs ) Here, you can specify which architectures you wish to target on Linux... either any or x86_64 Types (array types ) This is where you specify which type(s) your package supports. This can be build , binary , or app build means an application that is built from source code binary means a pre-built binary package app means a GUI-only .app bundle (macOS only) Dependencies (array dependencies ) Here is where you can place all the other packages you require to be installed to install your package. You can specify just a package's name, like go , or a minimum version to be required for the package, like python>=3.7 . Use (array use ) Here is where you can put a list of commands not installable from toaster that are required to install your program. Binary Here is an example of a simple binary program's TOML file The package in question is Go. [binary] type = 'gz' link_dirs = ['go/bin'] [[binary.arm64]] url = 'https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.16.darwin-arm64.tar.gz' [[binary.x86_64]] url = 'https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.16.darwin-amd64.tar.gz' URL (string url ) First and most importantly is the URL. This is a file archive ( .zip , tar.gz , etc.) This file is downloaded and then extracted to the package's directory Type (string type ) This is the type of archive you specified in the URL. ( zip , gz , xz , etc.) Link Dirs (bool link_dirs ) List of directorys that you wish to be linked to PATH after installation. Paths are relative to the package directory ({prefix}). Defaults to ['bin'] Build Here is an example [build] repo = 'https://github.com/foo/bar' branch = 'master' format_scripts = true scripts = [['./configure', '--prefix {prefix}'], [['make'], ['install']]] link_dirs = ['bin'] # Indentation is optional btw :) [[build.universal]] scripts = [['echo', 'hello, apple!']] post_scripts = [['echo', 'hello again, apple!']] [[build.uninstall]] [[build.uninstall.universal]] scripts = [['echo', 'bye bye, apple!']] Git packages The first way to get a package is from a git repo, here are the following properties for that: Repository (string repo ) The first two items here tell toaster which Git repo to download the source code from and which branch of that repo to use. Branch (string branch ) This is just a string which specifies which branch from the git repo should be used. This will default to master if not specified. Archives The second way to get a package is from an archive such as a tar.gz file, which should be downloaded. URL (string url ) First and most importantly is the URL. This is a file archive ( .zip , tar.gz , etc.) Type (string type ) This is the type of archive you specified in the URL. ( zip , gz , xz , etc.) Format Scripts? (bool format_scripts ) This is a boolean which tells toaster whether it should format scripts with things like {prefix} which contain data, such as where the package should be installed, in the case of {prefix}. Link dirs (array link_dirs ) List of directorys that you wish to be linked to PATH after installation. Paths are relative to the package directory ({prefix}). Defaults to ['bin'] Scripts (array scripts ) These are scripts to run during installation in the temp directory with the package's source code . This could be things like ./configure --prefix {prefix} This should be a list containing commands to run. Commands should also be a list, seperated by their arguments. For example, [['./configure', '--prefix {prefix}'], ['make', 'install']] . This is for security reasons. If you have experience with for example the subprocess library on Python, you are likely already be familiar with this. Post-scripts (array post_scripts ) These are scripts that are run right before installation is finished and are ran in the project directory. These work the same as regular scripts, just ran at a different time and in a different directory. Platform-Specific Instructions Platform/architecture specific instructions can be used. These will either overwrite their general values or append them (if the item is a list) For example: [[build.universal]] scripts = [['echo', 'hello, apple!']] post_scripts = [['echo', 'hello again, apple!']] [[build.linux_any]] scripts = [['echo', 'hello, tux!']] post_scripts = [['echo', 'hello again, tux!']","title":"Making a Package"},{"location":"Package%20Maintainers/makingapackage/#making-a-package","text":"So, there's an application you want to add to toaster? or maybe you're just curious?
